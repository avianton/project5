    <p>Parkour (French: [paʁkuʁ]) is a training discipline where practitioners (called traceurs) aim to get from one point to another in a complex environment, without assisting equipment and in the fastest and most efficient way possible. With roots in military obstacle course training and martial arts, parkour includes running, climbing, swinging, vaulting, jumping, plyometrics, rolling, and quadrupedal movement—whatever is suitable for the situation.[4][5]

Parkour is an activity that can be practiced alone or with others, and is usually carried out in urban spaces, though it can be done anywhere. [6][7] It involves seeing one's environment in a new way, and envisioning the potential for navigating it by movement around, across, through, over and under its features.[8][9]

Parkour as a type of movement was established by David Belle in France in 1988,[10][11] however the practice of similar movements in communities around the world brings into question the relevance of such an attribution.[12] The discipline was popularised in the late 1990s and 2000s through films, documentaries, video games, and advertisements.[12][13][14]</p></section>
